The Sorting Hat is written in [Clojure](https://www.clojure.org/) and requires [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to be installed.

### Command Line interface

To read a file using the command line interface:

`lein run <input-file>`

Example input files are provided in resources:

`lein run resources/people.csv`

Input files are expected to consist of only records separated by lines
with field separated by commas, pipes, or spaces.
Fields may be quoted if they contain a separator.
